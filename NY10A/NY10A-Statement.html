<p>Penney’s game is a simple game typically played by two players.  One version of the game calls for each player to choose a unique three-coin sequence such as <strong>HEADS TAILS HEADS (HTH)</strong>.  A fair coin is tossed sequentially some number of times until one of the two sequences appears.  The player who chose the first sequence to appear wins the game.</p> 
<p>For this problem, you will write a program that implements a variation on the Penney Game.  You willread a sequence of 40 coin tosses and determine how many times each three-coin sequence appears.  Obviously there are eight such three-coin sequences: <strong>TTT</strong>, <strong>TTH</strong>, <strong>THT</strong>, <strong>THH</strong>, <strong>HTT</strong>, <strong>HTH</strong>, <strong>HHT</strong> and <strong>HHH</strong>. Sequences may overlap.  For example, if all 40 coin tosses are heads, then the sequence HHH appears 38 times.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer P, (1 ? P ? 1000), which is the number of data sets that follow.  Each data set consists of 2 lines.  The first line contains the data set number N.  The second line contains the sequence of 40 coin tosses.  Each toss is represented as an upper case H or an upper case T, for heads or tails, respectively.  There will be no spaces on any input line.</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each data set there is one line of output.  It contains the data set number followed by a single space, followed by the number of occurrences of each three-coin sequence, in the order shown above, with a space between each one.  There should be a total of 9 space separated decimal integers on each output line.</p>
